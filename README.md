In this experiment, we will implement a simple Single Layer Neural Network in order to solve
a real wold machine learning problem with a real world data. In this experiment, you will get
familiar Python data science libraries such as; Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. At the end,
you will train the neural network to classify clinical cases to either benign or malignant.
